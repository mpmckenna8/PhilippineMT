#maptime Philippino map hack stuff.

For some non OSM Philippino map data see the Phillipine GIS Clearinghouse: http://philgis.org/

As always there's Natural earth boundary and state data: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/
http://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/

And export a lot of the new OSM data.

Maybe some imagery from thoat new tiny satelite or another aerial imagery provider.

I made a geojson dataset of Natural Earth's boundary lines for the Philippines. See this repo.
